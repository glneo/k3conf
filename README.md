###############################################################################



INTRODUCTION:
-------------

K3CONF is a Linux user-space standalone application designed to provide a
quick'n easy way to dynamically diagnose Texas Instruments' K3 architecture
based processors. K3CONF is intended to provide similar experience to that of
OMAPCONF that runs on legacy TI platforms.

**WARNING**: This is work in progress! Don't expect things to be complete in any
dimension. Use at your own risk. And keep the reset button in reach.



SUPPORT:
--------

K3CONF currently supports AM654, J721E, J7200, AM64x and AM62x Devices.
Legacy OMAP and DRA7 platforms are not supported.



Build Instructions:
-------------------

To build the output binary file run the following command:

	# make CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu-

Copy the output binary "k3conf" to your Filesystem.

That's it!!
